## Part 1: Differences between microcontroller and microprocessor

### Microcontroller
- Contains processor core, RAM, ROM, and I/O pins all on a single chip
- As it contains all the components need on a single chip, it does not require any external circuit to do its task
- made for specific task
- low cost as it is made by the complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology
- processing speed is about **8MHz to 50 MHz**

### Microprocessor
- has only a CPU inside them in one or few integrated circuit
- dependent on external circuit or peripheral to work
- made for general task (**complex task**)
- higher cost because of high number of external components require for such system
- processing speed is above **1GHz**
- power comsumption is high because of absence of power saving mode and also it connects to many external components

- Arduino Nano

  A rapid prototyping board that contains a microcontroller. Similar to a small computer, it can be programmed to control inputs and putputs peripheral devices.

- NodeMCU

  A development board with onboard WIFI to allow remote control and data logging over the Internet.

- Wireless radio

  Used for wireless communication for monitoring and remote control.

- Bluetooth communication

  Allows remote control and monitoring with android mobile devices.

- Variable resistor (Potentiometer)

  A potentiometer that can change resistance when rotated.

- Liquid crystal display

  To display sensor reading and text messages.

- Temperature and humidity sensor (DTH11)

  To measure surrounding temperature and humidity.

- Light sensor

  To measure the reading of ambient light.

- Real time clock (RTC)

  Used to store time even when power is not available because it has onboard coin cell battery backup.

- Switch (Push button)

  To allow Arduino to sense digital input to exwcute certain task.

- Light emmiting diode

  A diode that produces light commonly used for basic Arduino learning.

- Temperature sensor

  To measure surrounding temperature using analog sensor.

- Uno footprint prototyping area

  The Arduino Nano is connected to this UNO footprint. These connections allow prototyping of circuits and connection of shields.

- RGB LED

  A tri-color LED consists of red, green and blue light.
  
- Buzzer

  To generate alarm or tone audio to play melody.
